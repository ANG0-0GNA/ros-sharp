[ROS#](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp) is a set of open source software libraries and tools in [C\# ](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/csharp/csharp) for communicating with [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) from .[NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net) applications, in particular [Unity](https://unity3d.com/).

[Here](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/wiki/Info_Showcases) are some showcases illustrating what can be done with ROS#.
Community provided a variety of other application examples for ROS# [here](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/issues/20). Please don't hesitate to post yours!

## Notes On This Fork ##

This fork has some changes to allow ROS# to be used in UWP projects, such as the Microsoft HoloLens. Like the main ROS# branch, use 2019.x or later.

## How to get started ##

Step 1: Clone this project

Step 2, Option 1: Open the [Demo Project](https://github.com/EricVoll/ros-sharp/tree/master/ProjectSetup/RosSharpUnity) and copy its content. It is setup in a way, that it is buildable for UWP applications.

Step 2, Option 2: Follow these instructions:
 - Create a new Unity Project or use an existing one
 - Copy the [RosSharp folder](https://github.com/EricVoll/ros-sharp/tree/master/Unity3D/Assets) into the Assets Folder of your project
 - Configure the RosSharpClientUWP.dll to be used for the WSA platform and disable it for all other platforms
 - Configure the RosSharpClient.dll to be excluded for the WSA platform.
 - Configure the NewtonSoft.dll to be excluded from ALL platforms
 - Copy the [NewtonSoft AOT version](https://github.com/EricVoll/ros-sharp/tree/master/ProjectSetup/RosSharpUnity/Assets/Plugins) into your project (e.g. Assets/Plugins)

It is important to keep the NewtonSoft.dll in the RosSharp/Plugins folder, to "trick" unity during development time that a compatible version of NewtonSoft is present. This version is not AOT compilable and will not work in UWP applications using the IL2CPP backend. When building the "Game" Unity ignores this "faulty" version of NewtonSoft and uses the AOT-Version of NewtonSoft instead, which will work.

With this setup your project should work in Editor Mode and in UWP-Mode.

### Architecture ###

How does this work under the hood? In brief, I wrote a UWP-compatible WebSocket interface for ROS#, created a UWP-compatible version of RosBridgeClient.dll, called RosBridgeClientUWP.dll, added that to the Unity Project, specified proper platforms for all .dlls, and edited RosConnector.cs to automatically use to the UWP WebSocket interface.

#### Creating RosBridgeClientUWP.dll ####

ROS# contains a solution in the Libraries folder, which contains a project called RosBridgeClient. In the Protocols folder, I created a UWP compatible WebSocket interface. Next, I wrapped all WebSocket protocol files in preprocessor directives so only the UWP compatible interface would be compiled in a UWP-build. Finally, I created a second project in the solution called RosBridgeClientUWP. I made it a Windows Universal class library project, and copied all of the RosBridgeClient code over as links. Copying as links means that editing the code in one location changes it in both. Finally, I built the solution.

### Making Changes ###

If you want to make changes to the RosBridgeClient, like adding new messages, for instance, simply edit the code in the RosBridgeClient project (following the instructions from the main ROS# wiki), build the solution, and copy over the new RosBridgeClient.dll and RosBridgeClientUWP.dll.


### Compatibile With Mixed Reality Toolkit ###
This branch is compatible with Microsoft's Mixed Reality Toolkit. See the Preparing Unity Project Section.
